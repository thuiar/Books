Instructions: 

To compile you need ant (http://ant.apache.org/). You just need to run ant 
from this directory. It will create a jar file called GAssist.jar in the dist 
subdirectory.

The data files should be in the ARFF format used by the WEKA package 
(http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/).

Usage: java -jar GAssist.jar <config file> <train file> <test file>

There is a sample config file called config.txt in this directory.

To adapt it to you needs you have to tweak one parameters mainly: 
"numInterations", which defines the number of GA cycles that the system will
do.

For non-small datasets (more than 1000 instances) probably you will need to
modify also the "numStrata" parameter, increasing its default value (2).
